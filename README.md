# servicenow-ping-bot
This repository contains a Python-based Telegram bot designed to interact with a ServiceNow Personal Developer Instance (PDI). The bot is built to keep your ServiceNow instance alive and prevent it from being reclaimed due to inactivity. It works by periodically making API calls to the ServiceNow platform, ensuring that your PDI remains active.
